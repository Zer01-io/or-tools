"""Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows.

   This is a sample using the routing library python wrapper to solve a
   VRP problem.
   A description of the problem can be found here:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem.
   Distances are computed using the Manhattan distances. Distances are in km.

   The optimization engine uses local search to improve solutions, first
   solutions being generated using a cheapest addition heuristic.
